## The claim

Closing the Grant Street crossing will have a significant impact on the walking commute time/distance for residents of
the village on the west side of the Saw Mill River Parkway.

## The impact

- The average the difference in walking commute times and distances is **3.5 minutes and 0.15 miles**, respectively.

NOTE: This excludes the wait time for the signal at the Grant Street crossing which is currently 1 minute.

- This would affect **a maximum of 97 households**.

## The analysis

### Walking commute changes

Walking commute times from the households furthest north in the village to the train station would go from ~10 minutes
and ~0.4 miles to ~17 minutes and ~0.7 miles. A difference of ~7 minutes and ~0.3 miles.

Walking commute times from the households closest to the Grant Street crossing would go from ~6 minutes and ~0.2 miles
to ~13 minutes and ~0.5 miles. A difference of ~7 minutes and ~0.3 miles.

For households north of the Grant Street crossing the difference in walking commute times and distances is ~7 minutes
and
~0.3 miles. For households south of the Grant Street crossing the difference in walking commute times is less than ~7
minutes and ~0.3 miles.

### Maximum households impacted

This would affect 38 properties on Pleasant Avenue (address greater than 38 Pleasant Avenue), 44 properties on Sarles
Lane (addresses greater than 48 Sarles Lane), 11 properties on Mountain Road (addresses greater than 49 Mountain Road),
0 properties on Temple Place, and 4 properties on Crawford Street. Therefore, the maximum number of affected properties
is 97.

### Relative village impact vs. total properties

Pleasantville has approximately 2,600 properties (according to the assessor). This means that a maximum of 97
properties (3.7%) in the village would be affected by the closing of the Grant Street crossing assuming that they all
made use of the pedestrian crossing.

### Impact calculation explanation

The maximum walking commute difference is 7 minutes and 0.3 miles. The minimum difference is 0 minutes and 0 miles.
Properties near 38 Pleasant Avenue can already get to the train station faster via Pleasantville Road. 38 Pleasant
Avenue is break even point.
