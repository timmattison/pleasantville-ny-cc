## The claim

Closing the Grant Street crossing will have a significant impact on the vehicular traffic on Pleasantville Road.

## The impact

A maximum of 97 additional vehicles could exit onto Pleasantville Road from this neighborhood from the closure of the
Grant Street crossing at peak PM weekday times. This assumes that all the vehicles that utilize the Grant Street
crossing originate from the neighborhood and are not just passing through.

97 vehicles is 0.9% of existing daily traffic volume on Pleasantville Road (10,875) based on the most recent traffic counts
from Westchester County. Hourly traffic counts were not available to make a more detailed comparison.

Peak AM weekday times were not included in the traffic study.
